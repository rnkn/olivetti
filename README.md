Olivetti is a simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment.

Features
--------

- Set a desired text body width to automatically resize window margins
  to keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window.
- Text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a
  fraction of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
- Interactively change body width with:  
  `olivetti-shrink` <kbd>C-c [</kbd> <kbd>[</kbd> <kbd>[</kbd> ...  
  `olivetti-expand` <kbd>C-c ]</kbd> <kbd>]</kbd> <kbd>]</kbd> ...  
  `olivetti-set-width` <kbd>C-c \\</kbd>
- If `olivetti-body-width` is an integer, the text body width will scale
  with use of `text-scale-mode`, whereas if a fraction (float) then the
  text body width will remain at that fraction.
- Optionally remember the state of `visual-line-mode` on entry and
  recall its state on exit.
- Optionally hide the mode-line for distraction-free writing.

Requirements
------------

- Emacs 24.4
- If you use (n)linum-mode, you must disable it for buffer with
  olivetti-mode, or left margin will not be displayed.

Installation
------------

Olivetti is available through [MELPA][] and [MELPA-stable][]. I
encourage installing the stable version.

Alternately, download the [latest release][] and put it in your
`load-path`.

Known Bugs
----------

- `linum-mode` currently has a bug that overwrites margin settings,
  making it incompatible with Olivetti. More information here:
  <http://debbugs.gnu.org/20674>.
