Olivetti
========

Olivetti is a simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment.

width of 80 (bottom)

Features
--------

- Set a desired text body width to automatically resize window margins
  to keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window.
- Text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a
  fraction of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
- Interactively change body width with `olivetti-expand`,
  `olivetti-shrink` and `olivetti-set-width`.
- Optionally hide the modeline for distraction-free writing.

Requirements
------------

- Emacs 24.4
- If you use (n)linum-mode, you must disable it for buffer with
  olivetti-mode, or left margin will not be displayed.

Installation
------------

Olivetti is available through [MELPA][] and [MELPA-stable][]. I
encourage installing the stable version.

Alternately, download the [latest release][] and put it in your
`load-path`.
