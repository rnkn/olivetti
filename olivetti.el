;;; Commentary:

;; Olivetti is a simple Emacs minor mode for a nice writing environment.

;; Features
;; --------

;; - Set a desired text body width to automatically resize window margins
;;   to keep the text comfortably in the middle of the window.
;; - Text body width can be the number of characters (an integer) or a
;;   fraction of the window width (a float between 0.0 and 1.0).
;; - Interactively change body width with:
;;   `olivetti-shrink` C-c [ [ [ ...
;;   `olivetti-expand` C-c ] ] ] ...
;;   `olivetti-set-width` C-c \
;; - If `olivetti-body-width` is an integer, the text body width will scale
;;   with use of `text-scale-mode`, whereas if a fraction (float) then the
;;   text body width will remain at that fraction.
;; - Optionally remember the state of `visual-line-mode` on entry and
;;   recall its state on exit.
;; - Optionally hide the mode-line for distraction-free writing.

;; Olivetti keeps everything it does buffer-local, so you can write prose in one
;; buffer and code in another, side-by-side in the same frame. Or, by hiding the
;; mode-line and using a single window in a fullscreen frame, Olivetti provides a
;; nice distraction-free environment. For those looking for a hardcore
;; distraction-free writing mode with a much larger scope, I recommend
;; [writeroom-mode].

;; Requirements
;; ------------

;; - Emacs 24.4

;; Installation
;; ------------

;; Olivetti is available through [MELPA] and [MELPA-stable]. I
;; encourage installing the stable version.

;; Alternately, download the [latest release] and put it in your
;; `load-path`.

;; [melpa]: https://melpa.org/ "MELPA"
;; [melpa-stable]: https://stable.melpa.org/ "MELPA Stable"
;; [latest release]: https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/releases/latest "Olivetti latest release"

;; Known Bugs
;; ----------

;; - `linum-mode` in Emacs versions earlier than 26.1 has a bug that overwrites
;;   margin settings, making it incompatible with modes that work with margins.
;;   More information here: <https://debbugs.gnu.org/20674>.

;; Please report bugs on GitHub [Issues] page.

;; [issues]: https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/issues "Olivetti issues"

;; History
;; -------

;; See [Releases].

;; [releases]: https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti/releases "Olivetti releases"

;; Hints
;; -----

;; To always use a different width for a specific file, set a [File Variable]
;; specifying `olivetti-body-width`:

;;     M-x add-file-local-variable RET olivetti-body-width RET 66 RET

;; [file variable]: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Variables.html "File Variables"

An integer is best if you want text body width to remain
constant, while a floating point is best if you want text body
width to change with window width.

The floating point can anything between 0.0 and 1.0 (exclusive),
but it's better to use a value between about 0.33 and 0.9 for
best effect.
